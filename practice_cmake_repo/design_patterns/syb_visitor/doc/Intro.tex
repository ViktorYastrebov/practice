\section{Introduction}

Scrap Your Boilerplate (SYB) is approach for generic programming which is come from functional programming.
Actually, this file is a port of Haskell's library this the same name.

The main point of SYB approach is a generic traversal of data structure similar to well known in OOP world Visitor Pattern.
But traversal combinators from this library is more general so they are applicable in more areas.

See \url{http://www.cs.vu.nl/boilerplate/} for more information. Functions have similar names to Haskell's SYB library.

C++ template meta-programming technique is hardly used for implementation of this library.
Code style is similar to boost::mpl. And implemented metafunctions are compatible with it.
For template specialisation almost everywhere used \lstinline$boost::enable_if$ library.

Some changes are made due to imperativeness of C++ language and imposibility to port some concepts from Haskell to C++.

The action is specialized by concrete type name, or by type's shape.
Any class or struct is product of its fields. 

In the document mostly functionality needed for License System project is described. But the library is applicable to any C++ project.

Not full set of C++ types are implemented at the moment. But implemented set is enough for large area of tasks.

Actually all set of type's primitives from OOP design could be defined here.
